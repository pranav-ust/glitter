Create X data samples based on the following instructions:
Each sample should include four sentences: 2 preceding sentences, 1 matching sentence including the seed word, and 1 trailing sentence.
For each sample, use one of the seed words provided in the list: [REPLACE BY SEED WORD].
The sentence with the seed word should be in the third sentence in the sample.
In one of the four sentences, the samples should include a reference to disambiguate the gender of a seed word.
It should become obvious in one of the sentences which gender or genders the seed word refers to.
Be creative, vary the topic and disambiguation strategies.

Here are a few examples:
